# EX-06 - Looping
## AIM:
Write a C Program to print  even numbers ranging from M to N (including M and N values) in reverse order.

## ALGORITHM:
Start

Read two integer values M and N from the user.

If M < N, swap the values (so that we print from higher to lower).

Loop from M down to N:

If the current number is even (i.e., divisible by 2), print it.

End

## PROGRAM:

## RESULT:
Thus the program to print  even numbers ranging from M to N (including M and N values) in reverse order has been executed successfully
 
 


# EX-07-Nested-loop

## AIM:

Complete the C program to print the given triangular number pattern using loop.

## ALGORITHM:
Start

Read the number of rows n.

Loop from i = 1 to n:

For each row i, loop from j = 1 to i:

Print j followed by a space.

After inner loop, print a newline.

End

# EX-08-Functions

## AIM:

Write a C program to perform addition and subtraction of two numbers using functions (with argument and without return type).

## ALGORITHM:

1.	Declare two functions, one for addition and one for subtraction. Both functions should take two integer arguments.
2.	Inside the addition & subtraction function, add & subtract the two numbers and print the result.
3.	In the main function, declare two integer variables and read their values from the user.
4.	Call the addition and subtraction functions, passing the two numbers as arguments.

## PROGRAM:

## RESULT:

Thus the program to perform addition and subtraction of two numbers using functions has been executed successfully
 
 


# EX-09-Use For Loop

## AIM:

Write a c program to find the sum of even digits using for loop in a Given range

## ALGORITHM:

1.	Declare variables to store the input number and the sum of odd digits.
2.	Initialize the sum of odd digits to 0.
3.	Use a for loop to iterate through each digit of the input number.
4.	Inside the loop, extract the rightmost digit of the number (using the modulo operator % and division by 10).
5.	If the digit is odd, add it to the sum of odd digits.
6.	Print the sum of odd digits.

## RESULT:

Thus the program to find the sum of even digits using for loop in a Given range has been executed successfully.




# EX â€“ 10 - Factorial of a Number Using a Function
## AIM:
Write a C function/sub program to display the values according to given format using static storage class with return type & with arguments.
## ALGORITHM:
Start

Define a function displayValue(int x) that:

Uses a static integer variable count to track the number of times it's called.

Increments count on each call.

Prints the passed value and the call count in a formatted way.

In main():

Call the function multiple times with different arguments.

End
